Summary: A new blog

I've debated on creating a blog again, after not blogging for almost 15 years. Maintaining a WordPress blog seemed like _a lot_ of work. Then I discovered [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/) and thought this would be a low friction way to publish musings, experiments, technical discoveries, etc. And thus this blog is born. 

And for coming to visit my blog, here is a photo of my [dutch shepherd](https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dutch-shepherd/), Chester.
